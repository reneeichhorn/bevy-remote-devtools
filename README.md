# bevy-remote-devtools

![Small preview video showing the features listed below](./docs/preview.gif)

A toolset that allows you to debug / view any bevy application with a tauri based UI.

## Features

- Remote Connection to the bevy client over network with automatic discovery.
- Event tracing viewer to show the current tracing event logs.
- Assets browser that lets you view current loaded Assets (Mesh support only right now)
- Entity browser where you can see all entities in their nested structure and components.
- System profiler that allows you to trace `n` frames and outputs execution times.
- Visualize the current render graph to debug rendering.

## Usage

Install and configure the plugin in your target bevy app:

```toml
bevy-remote-devtools-plugin = "0.3"
```

or when targeting bevy main branch:

```toml
bevy-remote-devtools-plugin = { git = "https://github.com/reneeichhorn/bevy-remote-devtools.git" }
```

```rust
app
  .add_plugin(RemoteDevToolsPlugin::new("My App", 3030))
  // Optional: If you want to see fps and frame time in the tools.
  .add_plugin(FrameTimeDiagnosticsPlugin::default())
  // RemoteDevToolsPlugin will replace bevys LogPlugin with a similar implementation.
  // LogSettings Resource can be still used to configure what logs are shown.
  .add_plugins_with(DefaultPlugins, |group| group.disable::<LogPlugin>())
```

After starting your application you can now anytime connect with the UI app to your app.

Check the latest github release for binaries of the Tauri UI app or continue reading the readme to build it yourself.

## Compiling with the `dynamic` feature of bevy

In this situation you will likely end up with unresolved symbol errors from the linker. I'm not entirely sure why that happens but it seems to be a problem with rust itself. I'm happy if someone can find a nicer solution but for now the workaround is to remove `cdylib` from `hyper`.

```rust
[patch.crates-io]
hyper = { git = "https://github.com/reneeichhorn/hyper.git" }
```

## Identify entities

By default your entities are shown with the entities id. Depending on your setup this can make it really though to identify your entities easily. For this you can add the `DevInfo` component to have your entity named and also extend it with a couple of further debug infos like its module path where it was spawned / created. See the example in `/plugin/examples/3d.rs`.

```rust
  commands
      .spawn_bundle(PbrBundle { ... })
      .insert(dev_named!("MyNamedEntity"));
```

## Adding support for custom components.

To be able to view your own components it's enough to add bevys `Reflect` trait and register your component as a type.

```rust
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default)]
#[reflect(Component)]
pub struct MyComponent {
    velocity: Vec3,
}
```

```rust
app.register_type::<MyComponent>();
```

## Development on the Tauri UI

### Setup

Follow the [Tauri setup docs](https://tauri.studio/docs/getting-started/intro/) in your platform to get everything set up for Tauri development, then run

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Build

```bash
$ yarn build
```

Tauri will walk you through the rest.
